# delegate — MVP orchestrator

The deterministic half of the system. The skill tells agents *how to behave*;
this program decides *what runs next, on which model, and whether it is allowed
to* — see [`../DESIGN.md`](../DESIGN.md) §15.

**`adg`** is short for *agent delegation*. It is the Python package name, and the
prefix on everything this tool creates so it is greppable and never mistaken for
your own: branches `adg/<task-id>/<subtask>`, worktrees under
`.adg-worktrees/<project-key>/`, project config `.adg.yaml`, and the
`ADG_WINNOW_SCAN` override.

Python 3.9+, standard library only. No install step, no dependencies (the YAML
subset the project uses is parsed by `adg/yamlite.py`, because PyYAML is not in
the stdlib and requiring an install would be a worse trade).

## Use

```bash
orchestrator/delegate init                      # what's detected, who gets which role
orchestrator/delegate run "add a subtract API"  # run a task
orchestrator/delegate status                    # tasks for this project
orchestrator/delegate show --brief              # the human-readable summary
orchestrator/delegate resume --id T-001         # continue a parked task
```

Useful flags: `--dry-run` drives the state machine with no agents, `--adapter
local|herdr|mock` overrides runtime selection, `--no-panes` trades herdr's
visible agent panes back for cost accounting (pane sessions report no cost, so
`max_cost_usd` cannot bind while they are on), `--max-cost 5` lowers (never
raises) the cost cap, `--yes` auto-approves gates for unattended runs — merge
still never happens automatically.

## Project config

Optional `.adg.yaml` in the repository being worked on:

```yaml
fast:                       # run after every implementation attempt
  - "python3 -m pytest -q"
slow:                       # stage boundaries only (engine boots, full builds)
  - "python3 -m pytest -q --runslow"
hotspots:                   # force COMPLEX classification when mentioned
  - "src/combat/combat_system.gd"
ignore:                     # extra generated paths to exclude from scope accounting
  - "Build/*"
brainstorm: auto            # auto: design dialogue on complex attended tasks | always | never
test_author: auto           # auto (default) | never — independent tests on complex tasks
winnow: auto                # auto (default) | never — deterministic chaff scan
winnow_scan: ~/.claude/skills/code-winnow/scripts/scan.py   # only if autodetect misses
```

No config is legal — checks are then reported as *not run* rather than faked.

`winnow_scan` is only needed when autodetect misses. It looks in
`.claude/skills/` and `.agents/skills/` under the repo, then `~/.claude`,
`~/.cursor` and `~/.agents` — so a code-winnow installed anywhere else (another
runtime's skill directory, a bare clone) has to be pointed at, either with this
key or the `ADG_WINNOW_SCAN` environment variable. Either one wins over
autodetect, and a path that is set but wrong is reported as a misconfiguration
rather than quietly reported as "not installed".

## Quota failover

Subscription seats run out. When an agent CLI fails with its provider's
usage-limit shape — a 429, `usage limit reached`, `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` — the
orchestrator treats it as a *routing event*, not a failure (DESIGN.md §5.4,
§5.5): it opens a cooldown on that channel, re-selects the same role on another
enrolled channel, and carries on in the same worktree, so every checkpoint
commit the first agent made is still there.

**A quota failure does not consume an attempt.** `max_attempts_per_subtask`
bounds how many times an *approach* may be retried; an empty seat is not the
approach's fault. Escalation and failover stay separate and compose: a failover
target can still escalate later if the work itself is stuck.

The breaker lives in `$XDG_STATE_HOME/agent-delegation/channels.json` — beside
`projects/`, **not** inside one, because a quota belongs to a seat and two repos
driving the same subscription must see one cooldown. Expired entries are ignored
on read and pruned on write. A corrupt, wrongly-shaped, or unwritable file is
reported and treated as *no cooldowns*; it never invents one and never crashes a
run. Concurrency is honest about its limits: writes merge under an in-process
lock, which makes a lost breaker between two `delegate` processes recoverable
(the next call to that seat re-opens it) but does **not** make the file safe for
simultaneous writers in the strict sense — there is no cross-process lock.

`delegate channels --clear` is the override, and it really does unblock: the
breaker file is what `resume` consults, so clearing a seat lets a parked task
run again immediately rather than waiting out the recorded window.

```bash
orchestrator/delegate channels                       # cooldowns and quota draw
orchestrator/delegate channels --clear claude-seat   # override one
orchestrator/delegate resume --when-open --id T-001  # wait for the window, then resume
```

With every channel for a role cooled, the task parks as `quota_all_exhausted`
carrying the earliest reopen time, and `delegate resume` refuses until then
rather than starting a run every seat will reject.

### What is measured, and what is estimated

The cooldown's reopen time is the provider's own when it states one, and the
channel's configured `quota.window` otherwise — the fallback is logged, never
silent.

Utilization is **not** metered. Providers expose no counter, so the orchestrator
counts one invocation as one unit against `quota.est_capacity` inside the
window. That estimate drives the §5.4 shadow price — a subscription with
headroom costs ~0, and the same seat at 90% drawn prices itself above a metered
key — so cost-sensitive roles drift to the emptier seat before anything hits a
wall. `reserve_for` / `reserve_fraction` keep the declared share of a seat free
for the roles named there: a reserved role is never filtered out, a non-reserved
one is once the seat passes `1 − reserve_fraction`, *unless* that would leave it
with nowhere to go — then it gets the seat anyway and the demotion is logged. A
reservation that parks work it could have done is not worth having. "Nowhere to
go" is judged **after** the check for which agent CLI is actually installed, not
before: a candidate on an uninstalled CLI is not an alternative.

`weekly_cap: true` is **not** modelled on the utilization path: estimating a
weekly capacity from a five-hour `est_capacity` would be inventing a number. A
provider-stated weekly exhaustion still parks correctly, with the reset time the
provider gave.

## Layout

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `adg/machine.py` | The state machine. Every transition lives here. |
| `adg/store.py` | Task state outside the repo; project key from the git common dir. |
| `adg/router.py` | Capability scoring, enrollment, escalation ceiling, quota shadow price. |
| `adg/quota.py` | Quota-exhaustion classification per agent kind; reset and window parsing. |
| `adg/cooldown.py` | Per-channel breakers and the invocation meter, shared across projects. |
| `adg/limits.py` | Hard limits, checked before the action, failing closed. |
| `adg/runtime.py` | The seven-operation adapter: `local`, `herdr` (agents run in visible panes), `mock`. |
| `adg/verify.py` | Deterministic checks and mechanical scope comparison. |
| `adg/winnow.py` | Optional [code-winnow](https://github.com/wyc79/code-winnow-skill) scanner — referenced, never vendored. |
| `adg/companions.py` | Detects karpathy-guidelines and superpowers once, and declares them in `task.json`. |
| `adg/brief.py` | Human-facing gate briefs, plus the jargon lint. |
| `adg/schema.py` | Report/verdict validation against the skill's schemas. |
| `adg/prompts.py` | Injects role, paths, scope, budget — and nothing else. |
| `adg/yamlite.py` | The YAML subset used by the registry and plan files. |

## Invariants worth not breaking

- **Nothing is written into the working repository.** Task state lives in
  `$XDG_STATE_HOME/agent-delegation/`; the project key comes from
  `git rev-parse --git-common-dir`, which is identical from every worktree.
- **Attended mode never commits to your branch**, and no mode merges. The
  terminal state is a patch file or a pushed branch. There is no commit path to
  the user's branch in this codebase — checkpoint commits happen only inside
  throwaway worktrees.
- **Limits fail closed.** A missing or unparseable limit parks the task rather
  than meaning "unlimited".
- **The top model tier needs two switches**: enrollment *and* the ceiling.
- **Liveness is not success.** An agent settling `idle` proves nothing; a
  schema-valid report plus real verify output does.
- **A quota wall is a routing event, not an attempt.** Failing over to another
  seat never spends `max_attempts_per_subtask`, and never substitutes for
  escalation.
- **The skill names no model and no runtime.** If either leaks into
  `agent-delegation/`, the boundary has broken.

## Tests

```bash
python3 orchestrator/tests/test_orchestrator.py
python3 orchestrator/tests/test_failover.py
```

The end-to-end tests drive the real state machine over a real git repository
with a scripted adapter, so the whole pipeline — plan, isolated implementation,
verify, review, integrate — is exercised without spending a token.

No agent CLI has to be installed for the suite to pass. Tests that exercise
launch routing stub `can_run`, the single seam that decides whether a kind is
usable, rather than depending on a vendor binary being on PATH.

## Scope

Implemented: the full pipeline, parallel subtasks in separate worktrees (bounded
by `max_parallel_agents`, serialized on scope or hotspot overlap), the Integrator
on merge conflicts, an independent Test Author on complex tasks, real cost
accounting from the CLI, autonomous mode ending at an opened PR, model-rendered
briefs, and quota-aware failover with per-channel cooldowns and a utilization
shadow price.

Still absent: *live* quota metering (the draw above is estimated from invocation
counts, not read from a provider), weekly-cap modelling, telemetry-driven
registry recalibration, and container isolation. Escalation is two signals
(`test_stuck`, `scope_overrun`) and a two-rung ladder.

## Known defect

`TestWaveRaces.test_one_subtask_escalating_stops_the_run_even_as_a_sibling_succeeds`
and `TestParallelEndToEnd.test_two_subtasks_get_two_worktrees_and_both_land`
fail intermittently — roughly 1 run in 8 of the **full** suite, never
reproducible in isolation (12/12 clean runs of the test alone). Both are
parallel-path tests, and in the captured failure an implementer's `escalate`
report did not reach the halt check, so a wave subtask completed that should
have parked.

Serializing `task.json` mutations and making verify/transcript ids unique per
invocation reduced it from 2/8 to 1/8 without removing it, so at least one
shared-state race remains in the wave path. **Treat parallel mode as
unfinished**: run sequentially (one subtask per plan, or `max_parallel_agents:
1`) until this is closed. The sequential path is not affected.
